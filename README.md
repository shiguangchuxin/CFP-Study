# CFP Exam Study Repository

🎉 **I PASSED the CFP Exam on November 10, 2025!** 🎉

This is my personal study repository that helped me pass the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) exam on my second attempt. After failing in November 2024, I rebuilt my study approach using AI-powered guided learning with Claude Code - and it made all the difference.

**Thanks to AI and Claude Code**, I went from a failed attempt to **82% mastery** (60/73 topics) across 23 focused study sessions, ultimately passing the exam.
